# TubeStalk

TubeStalk is a browser extension that enhances your YouTube viewing experience by automatically pausing videos when you look away and resuming them when you return your gaze. This ensures you never miss a moment of your favorite content.

## Features

- **Automatic Video Control**: Uses face detection to pause and play YouTube videos based on your attention.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works on all YouTube pages without any additional setup.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple enable/disable controls accessible via a popup menu.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Processes video data locally without sending it to external servers.

## How It Works

TubeStalk leverages advanced face detection models to determine when you are looking at the screen. The extension uses a combination of face landmark detection and recognition to ensure accurate and reliable performance.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gohar-wahidy/TubeStalk.git
   ```

3. Enable "Developer mode" (usually a toggle in the top right corner).

4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the cloned `TubeStalk` directory.

5. Grant camera access when prompted to enable face detection.

## Usage
